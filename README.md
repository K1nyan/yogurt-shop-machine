**Persona Lab below**

Persona1: Henry Potter (11yo)
- Henry Potter was born in Pensacola, Florida. He grew up in a kind neighborhood
where, whenever you greet someone, they welcome you back, and with his 
parents being extra kind, he also grew up to be a kind kid. He liked to play 
soccer, and he was one of the best players on his local soccer team. Their team 
won tournaments, and he was even in the local newspaper one time. Whenever 
his team won, his mother baked chocolate cake for him. He loves chocolate, and 
whenever he and his mother go grocery shopping, he begs her to buy some 
chocolate candy. When he entered middle school, he found a yogurt shop with 
plenty of options, which included chocolate toppings. After a month, going to this 
yogurt shop on the way back home became his routine. He usually gets the 
medium-sized yogurt with M&M’s topping. If he feels like having extra chocolate, 
he adds chocolate drizzle. He sometimes eats in-store, other times on the way 
home, or leaves it in the fridge till after dinner so he can have it for dessert. He 
wants to eat it every day, but his mother does not allow him to have unhealthy 
food all the time, and that is why sometimes, he has it secretly.

- Scenario: The Mistake
  - One day, on a sunny afternoon, Henry wanted what he usually gets, the 
medium-sized yogurt with M&M’s and chocolate drizzle for extra chocolate 
flavor. However, he accidentally pressed the blueberries option and got
blueberries and chocolate drizzle for toppings. He asked the employee if 
he could trade it with the one he wanted, and since that employee knew 
he always got the M&M’s toppings, the employee kindly traded the 
yogurts.

Persona2: Hana Green (24yo)
- Hana Green was born in Pensacola, Florida. She grew up in a loving family. Her 
mother was a botanist, and her father liked to grow crops in his backyard. She 
experienced nature more than anyone in her classes and was always in first 
place in biology. She decided to move after graduating from high school to where 
there is a lot of greenery surrounding the neighborhood. She started her own 
garden like her father, and enjoyed the peace within nature. She started looking 
for jobs in the area and found a small yogurt shop. The yogurt shop wasn’t 
famous. However, it had a happy atmosphere with children’s laughter, and real 
plants taken care of by the owner. She decided to work there, and the owner 
welcomed her for her knowledge in botany. After about a month, the store was 
filled with beautiful colors and a sweet scent from multiple flowers. She felt like 
this was what she wanted to do and continued to decorate the store. She loved it 
when the customers talked about how beautiful and how well taken care of the 
flowers were. She also liked it when the children were talking about how much 
fun school was while eating their yogurt.

- Scenario: Buggy Screen?
  - One day, she was getting multiple complaints about the screen not 
functioning properly. She tried to make herself a yogurt, and she understood 
what the customers were saying. Some parts of the screen did not respond,
and others were always being pressed. She quickly tried rebooting the 
system, but could not solve the issue. The issue was just that the screen got 
dirty and wet, causing it to not register the finger on the screen. From then on, 
she takes time to clean the touch screen.

- Features

  - A home screen that asks customers to wash their hands before use
  - A censer that detects when a finger is close to the screen (not touching
